"""
select_top_features.py

Purpose:
This script performs feature selection from the preprocessed training dataset 
by identifying the top N sensor features that have the strongest correlation with RUL.

Workflow:
- Loads preprocessed training data (with computed RUL) from preprocessing.py
- Computes Pearson correlation of each sensor with RUL
- Selects the top N features based on absolute correlation values
- Creates a refined training dataset including only: unit, cycle, top N sensors, and RUL
- Saves the new dataset for model training

Output:
- dataset/df_train_selected.csv â€” streamlined dataset for model training
