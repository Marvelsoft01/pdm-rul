predict.py

This script launches a Streamlit-based user interface for interacting with the trained Random Forest model.

What it does:
- Loads a previously trained RUL (Remaining Useful Life) prediction model from the local file system.
- Provides two ways to input sensor readings: file upload (CSV) or manual entry via the UI.
- Predicts the RUL based on the input values.
- Offers technician-friendly feedback depending on the predicted RUL severity.
- Includes downloadable sample CSV for easy testing.

This interface is ideal for local demos, pilot testing, or as a starting point for future production deployment.

    - RUL (Remaining Useful Life) estimates how many more cycles the component can complete before likely failure.
