Purpose:
Refines feature selection by training a Random Forest on the top 10 correlated features 
(from df_train_selected.csv) and selecting the top 5 based on model-driven importance.

Workflow:
- Loads the dataset with top 10 features previously selected
- Trains a Random Forest Regressor on these features
- Extracts the top 5 most important sensor features from the model
- Combines them with 'unit' and 'cycle' to form the final feature set
- Saves a new dataset containing only the refined top 5 features

Output:
- dataset/df_test_selected.csv â€” final dataset for model training and prediction
